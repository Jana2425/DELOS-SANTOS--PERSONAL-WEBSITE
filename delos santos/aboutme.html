            <p class="text"> Hobbies
                <p class="paragraph"> Reading books on Wattpad is one of my pastimes; romance and thrillers are my favorite genres. I enjoy thrillers because I enjoy when the narrative gets extremely interesting and the mystery begins to unravel, and I enjoy romances because of the fictional man's character, since these days it's actually the other way around. I can also play a variety of sports, such as baseball, volleyball, and pool. Although I'm still learning, I enjoy baking as well. While I can play mobile games, I'm not that adept at them.
            <p class="text"> Favorite Foods
                <p class="paragraph"> Kare-Kare is my favorite dish to eat with rice; I love the soft parts, such as the meats and fats, and it also pairs well with bok choy and shrimp paste. I'm a huge fan of ice cream for dessert, especially if it tastes like cookies and cream or matcha. Aside from ice cream, I enjoy many other desserts consisting of matcha, including as donuts, croffles, and mochi. I realize that many people dislike or detest matcha, but I promise that it's really superb.
                    <p class="text"> Dream Destination
                    <p class="paragraph"> My dream place would be Alegria or Cagayan De Oro in the Philippines because, despite the fact that my favorite characters are fictional, I still want to visit the places where they were born because I want to experience the same thrill of knowing that. I would like to go to Japan tooÂ because of its culture and abundance of tourist attractions. I also want to see the spider lily, which is one of my favorite flowers to see in bloom, and I definitely desire to try their famous 7/11 and Japanese food.
