               <p>Hi there, my name is Jana Rose C. Delos Santos, but you can call me Ja or Ana if that's your preference. Being the middle child, I have two sisters: Janesa Rose C. Delos Santos is my youngest sister, and Febvie Rose C. Delos Santos is my oldest. As my friends have pointed out, I'm a really optimistic person who also goes with the flow, especially when it comes to adventure because I enjoy doing exciting things like hiking and surfing. I also appreciate nature, especially the falls. I find them to be quite peaceful, and my favorite waterfall is Tinago Falls in Iligan City, which I was made aware of through one of my all-time favorite books. </p>
